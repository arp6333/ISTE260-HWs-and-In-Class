1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,280
man! I really need a summer internship so
I can graduate on time

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
I remember hearing in my co-op prep
course then you just send 100 emails

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
just to get ten interviews

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,840
I've been
using this browser extension called Pen pal

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,480
it's really helped me with
generating emails for a bunch of job interviews I've had to do

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,800
you should check it
out and see how it works

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,640
yes, that sounds good.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,160
I'm gonna show you a
couple of great features of pen pal

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,880
one is that you can upload your resume once and
have it save it so that you can use it multiple times

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,160
so you can go to my
account, my resume,  and then you can upload a resume so you would browse and upload
it

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:56,080
and then you can say upload and it'll be saved so that you can use it when
you're composing emails

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,640
another similar feature is you can save your skills so that you don't have to continue typing them over and over again

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,720
so you would go
to the edit profile page and in there

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,560
you could edit your skills and then hit
the Save button and it'll take you back

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,380
to my account

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,689
another great feature is
when you go to compose your emails so

17
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,320
I'll hit the compose email button and so
here are the list of different templates

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,000
that are saved and you can also save
custom templates.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
in this case I'm a student and I'm trying to write a job inquiry email so I'll click on that

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,160
template and it'll show you a preview of
the email and you'll hit next button and

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,640
then you can fill out the fields so the
skills will automatically be populated

22
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,880
with that you saved and then you can edit
the following fields so this would be

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,219
the employer name I mean the employer
email the employer name and the company

24
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:06,850
name so you can fill those out and then
you hit the next button and it'll

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,020
automatically generate an email for you
and it'll address it to the right person

26
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,680
from
the email that you've provided and it'll

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,850
fill out just a general template
including your skills and the company

28
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:25,520
that you want to work for and then when
you hit the next button it provides a

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,380
built-in error checker so this is saying
to select the texts highlighted because

30
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,350
it detected an error so you can click on
that and you can say okay so it wants to

31
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,960
say I am instead of I'm so you can hit
apply correction and it'll change it for

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,020
you and then after that you can hit the
attach resume so that your resume will

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,130
automatically be sent as an attachment
to the email and then you can hit the

34
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,770
send button and it's sent so that would
be one email and then you could go back

35
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,560
and do similar thing and all you would
have to do is edit the employer fields

36
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:11,520
to the next employer that you would send
it to and can write a lot of emails efficiently

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,160
